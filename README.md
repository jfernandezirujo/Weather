# WeatherApp

WeatheApp is an iOS application that retrieves the user's current location to provide real-time weather information. It follows Clean Architecture principles and uses the MVVM pattern to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase. The app leverages Combine for reactive programming, enabling efficient handling of asynchronous data flow. By integrating external APIs, WeatherApp delivers accurate forecasts, including current conditions and a five-day outlook.
